## Project Overview

GitScape API is the official backend for [GitScape](https://gitscape.ai/), a platform for generating structured digests and summaries from any git repository. This API powers the [GitScape Web](https://github.com/jmxt3/Git-Scape-Web) frontend and is designed for extensibility, performance, and ease of deployment (notably on Google Cloud Run).

- **Main repo:** https://github.com/jmxt3/Git-Scape-Web
- **Live site:** https://gitscape.ai/

## Architecture & Project Structure

- `main.py` ‚Äì FastAPI entrypoint, defines API and WebSocket endpoints.
- `converter.py` ‚Äì Core logic for cloning, analyzing, and digesting git repositories.
- `app/` ‚Äì Application package:
  - `api.py` ‚Äì FastAPI app factory and CORS setup.
  - `config.py` ‚Äì Environment and settings management.
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` ‚Äì Python dependencies.
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äì Containerization for deployment.
- `.env.example` ‚Äì Example environment configuration.

## API Overview

- `GET /` ‚Äì Health check and welcome message.
- `GET /converter` ‚Äì Clone a git repo and return a Markdown digest (blocking HTTP).
- `WS /ws/converter` ‚Äì WebSocket endpoint for real-time progress and digest streaming.

See the [OpenAPI docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) when running locally for full details.

## Getting Started (Development Setup)

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmxt3/Git-Scape-API.git
   cd Git-Scape-API
   ```
2. **Install Python 3.10+** and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or use `pip`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Copy environment config:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env as needed
   ```
4. **Run the API locally:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   # or
   fastapi dev
   ```
5. **Access docs:**
   - Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
   - ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## Testing

*Tests are not yet included. PRs for test coverage are welcome!*

## Code Style & Conventions

- Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting.
- Use type hints and docstrings for all public functions.
- Keep API endpoints and business logic separated (see `main.py` vs `converter.py`).

## Deployment Notes for Google Cloud Run:

These are general steps you would follow to deploy this application to Google Cloud Run. You'll need `gcloud` CLI installed and configured.

1.  **Enable APIs:**
    * Ensure the Cloud Run API and Artifact Registry API (or Container Registry API) are enabled for your Google Cloud project.
    ```bash
    gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
    gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
    ```

2.  **Authenticate gcloud:**
    * If you haven't already, authenticate the `gcloud` CLI:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    gcloud auth configure-docker
    ```
    (You might need to specify a region for Docker, e.g., `gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`)

3.  **Set Project ID:**
    * Set your current project (replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`):
    ```bash
    gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```

4.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    * Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, and `requirements.txt`.
    * Build the image using Cloud Build (recommended) or locally with Docker.
        * **Using Cloud Build (builds in the cloud and pushes to Artifact Registry):**
            Replace `YOUR_REGION`, `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, and `YOUR_IMAGE_NAME`.
            ```bash
            gcloud builds submit --tag YOUR_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest .
            ```
            (If you don't have an Artifact Registry repository, you'll need to create one first: `gcloud artifacts repositories create REPOSITORY_NAME --repository-format=docker --location=YOUR_REGION`)

        * **Building locally with Docker (then push):**
            ```bash
            docker build -t YOUR_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest .
            docker push YOUR_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest
            ```

5.  **Deploy to Cloud Run:**
    * Deploy the container image to Cloud Run. Replace placeholders.
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy YOUR_SERVICE_NAME \
        --image YOUR_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME/YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest \
        --platform managed \
        --region YOUR_DEPLOY_REGION \
        --allow-unauthenticated \
        --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
    * `YOUR_SERVICE_NAME`: A name for your Cloud Run service (e.g., `my-fastapi-app`).
    * `YOUR_DEPLOY_REGION`: The region where you want to deploy (e.g., `us-central1`).
    * `--allow-unauthenticated`: Makes the service publicly accessible. Remove this if you want to manage access via IAM.

6.  **Access Your Service:**
    * After deployment, Cloud Run will provide a URL for your service. You can access your FastAPI app at that URL.

**Important Considerations for Cloud Run:**
* **PORT Environment Variable:** Cloud Run sets a `PORT` environment variable that your application must listen on. The `Dockerfile`'s `CMD` handles this by using `${PORT:-8080}`, which means it will use the `PORT` variable if set, or default to `8080` otherwise.
* **Statelessness:** Cloud Run services should be stateless. Any persistent state should be stored in external services like Cloud SQL, Firestore, or Cloud Storage.
* **Concurrency:** Configure concurrency settings based on your application's needs.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Cloud Run integrates with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring. Standard output (`print` statements, logging libraries) will be captured.
